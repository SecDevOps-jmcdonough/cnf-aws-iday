# Secure AWS workloads with FortiGate CNF SaaS

![](./images/image-cnf-overview.png)


## Welcome!

AWS Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is elastic, complex, and quite different than traditional on-premise networking. In this workshop you will learn how to use FortiGate Cloud Native Firewall as a Service (FortiGate CNF) to protect your AWS workloads deployed in common architecture patterns.

This workshop is intended to help accomplish the following:

  * Learn common AWS networking concepts such as routing traffic in and out of VPCs for various traffic flows
  * Interact with FortiGate CNF Portal to deploy CNF instances, build security policy sets, and deploy them
  * Test traffic flows in an example environment and use FortiGate CNF to control traffic flows
